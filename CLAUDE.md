## i18n

This site supports 5 locales: `ru` (default), `en`, `sr`, `es`, `de`. Translations must always stay complete and in sync across all five.

- Any new user-facing string (page copy, component text, labels, aria-labels, alt text, meta title/description, error messages, etc.) must be added to all five locales at the same time — never RU-only "for now".
- Translations must sound natural in the target language, not literal word-for-word from Russian.
- Serbian needs correct grammatical case agreement (locative/genitive/accusative depending on preposition) — not just vocabulary swapped in.
- Store new strings in the existing i18n structure — `src/i18n/dictionaries/{ru,en,sr,es,de}.ts` for shared chrome, `src/i18n/content/*.ts` for page-body content — reusing existing keys where possible (DRY) rather than a new inline literal per component.
- Before considering any UI change done, verify no hardcoded RU-only text was left behind (e.g. `grep -rP '[а-яА-ЯёЁ]' src/components src/pages src/layouts` outside of comments/intentional RU-only surfaces).
- Case-study content (`src/content/{cases,autoservice-cases,detailing-cases}`) is the one exception to "admin writes it by hand": the admin only ever writes the `ru` fields in Keystatic, and `.github/workflows/translate-cases.yml` auto-translates en/sr/es/de on every push that touches a case file.

## Dependency versions

Every dependency in `package.json` must be pinned to an exact version — no `^` or `~` ranges. This applies to `dependencies` and `devDependencies` alike.

`pnpm add --save-exact` (or `-e`) does not reliably write an exact version in this repo — confirmed it silently kept the `^` prefix even when passed explicitly (both on a version bump and on a no-op re-add). Don't trust the flag: after adding or updating any package, run `grep '"\^' package.json` and hand-edit any caret left behind before considering the change done.
